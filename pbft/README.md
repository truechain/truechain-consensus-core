# PBFT-Core
===

*These codes have not gone through reviews. Please use them with cautions*

This code base is an ongoing implementation of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol. This PBFT will be the BFT layer in our hybrid consensus design. For this testnet, we will be using PBFT alone to support services and meanwhile working on development and research on the rest of hybrid consensus.

Although there exists a bunch of existing PBFT implementations, we decide to write our own version to get fully control of every details and to conveniently make necessary extensions so that it could fit into the hybrid consensus protocol (which requires more than a standard PBFT).

### Installation

#### Step 1

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [HyperMake](http://evo-cloud.github.io/hmake/quickguide/install/).

Make sure you have hmake in your `$GOBIN` path.

### Step 2

```
go get -u github.com/truechain/truechain-consensus-core
```

### Step 3

Make sure you have `$GOBIN` in `$PATH`:

```
export GOBIN=$GOPATH/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$GOBIN
```

Then,

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/truechain/truechain-consensus-core/pbft
hmake
cp bin/{linux/darwin}/truechain-engine $GOBIN/
```

### Run

Populate a sample `~/hosts` file with repetitive 5-6 lines containing loopback IP address `127.0.0.1`. 

```
$ truechain-engine
```

This triggers both server and client subroutines. Also displays progress of key signing, data exchange and ledger log.

### Build

In case you have a new dependency that's not listed in `src/vendor/manifest` folder, just run this from `src/`:

```
gvt fetch github.com/fatih/color
```

This would add a folder `src/vendor` if not already present, and would also generate/append to `src/vendor/manifest`.

#### Building it all with hmake and docker

This project uses:

- [HyperMake](https://github.com/evo-cloud/hmake) to interact with toolchain (containerized environment) and build cross-platform binaries.
- `gvt` to manage dependencies.


```
$ hmake --targets
$ hmake check
$ hmake build
```

The first time, it would download:

- TrueChain's docker image `go-toolchain` from https://hub.docker.com/r/truechain/go-toolchain/
- Dependencies as per `src/vendor/manifest`, which again, could be generated using [gvt](https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt).

The binaries would be available in `bin/`'s platform-specific folders.

#### Building it all with a shell script

Additionally, you could choose to build without using containers. For a very basic sanity test, run the following:

```
./support/scripts/build.sh {linux/darwin}
```

Note: you could also use `darwin` as an argument to build.sh instead of `linux` to get an OSX binary. Support for more will be extended soon.


### Deployment

To be added.

### Benchmark
